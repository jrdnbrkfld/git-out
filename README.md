# Milestone Project 3 - GitOut, a choose your own adventure game.
## Purpose
This website was created to complete the third Milestone Project for Code Insitute's Full Stack Software Developer course. I built this from the ground up using knowledge I gained from the previous modules. These being Python and User Centric Design. The full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section further down.

Users of this website are able to play a short story with multiple branching paths leading to either a win or a loss.

## User Experience Design

### User Stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
* As a First Time user, I want a simple but effective way of making my choices while playing the game.
* As a First Time user, I want to clearly see how my choices are affecting the game for good or bad.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning user, I want to be able to return to see if I can beat the computer again or for the first time.
