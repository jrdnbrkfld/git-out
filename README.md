# Milestone Project 3 - GitOut, a choose your own adventure game.
## Purpose
This website was created to complete the third Milestone Project for Code Insitute's Full Stack Software Developer course. I built this from the ground up using knowledge I gained from the previous modules. These being Python and User Centric Design. The full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section further down.

Users of this website are able to play a short story with multiple branching paths leading to either a win or a loss.
