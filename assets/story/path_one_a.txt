You sprint to the exit.
While fumbling around trying to open the door,
you hear a guttural moan from down the hallway.
“Why won't this damn door open?!”, you scream.
You begin to hear footsteps from around the corner.
Growing louder with each stride.
Then you remember, the boss locked the door…
With seconds until whatever is approaching you appears, you must choose!

Path 1: Smash through the glass.
Path 2: Run back into the office and hide.
