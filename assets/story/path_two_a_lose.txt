You open the shutter, the smell overwhelms you.
Blood is all over the walls and floor.
Body parts are strewn across the room, mostly half chewed.
You notice a pale gaunt girl crouched in the corner.
With her razor sharp nails, she charges and starts wildly attacking you.
One violent swipe hits your neck, severing your jugular vein.
Bleeding out, the girl stands over you licking her lips.
Your body was never found.
