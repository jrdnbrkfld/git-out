Could this be a cruel prank the boss is playing on you?
Then you hear a guttural moan from down the hallway.
You begin to hear footsteps coming from the hall. 
Growing louder with each stride, until you sense the presence of someone in the room with you.
Frantically scanning the area, you look for anything to use as protection.

Quickly, you have to do something!

Path 1: Stay hidden, like the coward you are.
Path 2: Attack them with the letter opener.
