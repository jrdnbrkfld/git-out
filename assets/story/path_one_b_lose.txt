You stay under the desk, sobbing with snot dripping down your face.
The noise you are making is akin to a toddler losing their favourite toy.
Suddenly the girl sends the desk flying, revealing you curled up on the floor.
She attacks you, severing your jugular vein.
Bleeding out, the girl stands over you licking her lips.
Your body was never found.
