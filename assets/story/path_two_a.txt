You grab your torch and make your way into the hallway.
The strange noises begin again.
You start getting freaked out, the building has a strange vibe to it at night.

A glowing red light can be seen in the crack of the shutters.

Path 1: Lock it back up, someone's possessions are in there.
Path 2: Open the shutter and investigate.
