You take a sip of your brew and begin to feel sick.
Moments later you black out.
You wake up some time later, it is now pitch black in the room.
Vomiting over yourself, you realise you are tied to the chair.
A pale gaunt girl stands in front of you licking her lips.
“Who are you? WHAT WAS IN THAT DRINK!?”, you scream.
With her razor sharp nails, she swipes your neck, severing your jugular vein.
You're bleeding out, all you can see is her beginning to eat away at your forearm.
Your body was never found.
