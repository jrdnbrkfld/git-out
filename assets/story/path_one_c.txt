You make your way into the main halls, confused about the nature of the note.
Could this be a cruel prank the boss is playing on you?
Then you hear a guttural moan from down the hallway.
You notice a pale gaunt girl peeking staring at you from the end of the hall.
You begin to approach her, she must be a customer that accidentally got locked in. 
Her behaviour is erratic, moaning constantly like she is in agony.
She charges at you! 
Quickly, you have to do something!

Path 1: Run into the lock up to your left and trap her in.
Path 2: Charge her, you aren't scared!
