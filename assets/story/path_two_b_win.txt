You leave the brew and investigate the hallway.
After turning the corner, you see a pale gaunt girl.
She lets out a bloodcurdling scream and charges.
You narrowly avoid her razor sharp nails.
While she is falling over, she smashes through the glass on the exit.
You throw her to the side and dart through the gap.
Sprinting towards the main road, you flag down the bus.
Covered in sweat, you board and begin hyperventilating in front of the driver.
“DRIVE! SHE’S BEHIND ME!”, you scream.
In a panic the driver puts his foot down, throwing you to the floor.
She stops chasing you and retreats back to the building.
