You peel the note open.
"Why is there blood on it?", you ask yourself.
The writing is barely legible, but you persevere.
Your face goes pale, your hairs stick up on your arms.
The note reads…
“I'm so sorry, I had no other choice.
She is hungry.”
What would you like to do?

Path 1: Run to the door and try to get out.
Path 2: Hide underneath the desk.
Path 3: Make your way into the main storage halls.
